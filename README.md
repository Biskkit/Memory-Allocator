This was a project for a course. All work in the `sfmm.c` file is my own. The purpose of the assignment was to implement a dynamic memory allocator with basic functions mimicking `free()`, `malloc()`, etc.

## DISCLAIMER:
* The `sfmm.h` file was provided by the instructor. It contains assignment specifications, data structures, and comments that are **not my work**.

* There was also a pre-built binary supplied with the original assignment. This binary allowed the helper functions like `sf_mem_start()` or `sf_mem_end()` (along with others) to function and help students write their code. This binary is **not included in this repository**. There are other functions that depended on this binary. They can be found in sfmm.h near the end of the file under the comment "/* sfutil.c: Helper functions already created for this assignment. */"

* As the binary is not included, this repository cannot be built and run like it was meant to originally. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my logic and implementation in `sfmm.c`
